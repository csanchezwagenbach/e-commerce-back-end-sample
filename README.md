# e-commerce-back-end-sample

## Description
This project represents the mock construction of a functioning e-commerce website's back end functionality. Utilizing Sequelize to configure an express.js API to interact with a MySQL database, this back end offers a sample suite of services to both businesses and consumers alike. This project was undertaken with the dual purpose of familiarizing the developer with the architecture of e-commerce sites and demonstrating back end development competence. The application is live, functional, and may be accessed by visiting the [public repository](https://github.com/csanchezwagenbach/e-commerce-back-end-sample), downloading all included files, opening their location in the terminal, and, finally, running the command "npm i" followed by "npm run seed" and "node server.js".

## Installation
To run the application users must first download NodeJS. A step by step guide to download NodeJS onto your machine may be found [here.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs)

Additionally, the Insomnia API Client allows full exploration of the application's functionality. A step by step guide to download Insomnia onto your machine may be found [here.](https://insomnia.rest/download)

## Usage
Utilizing command-line interface and the Insomnia API Client, users may explore the RESTful routes created by the program and explore the CRUD capabilities afforded. The video linked below represents a tutorial of creating/seeding the database with CLI and demonstration of route functionality.

To afford additional security, this application takes advantage of environmental variables to store database information. Users will need information regarding their own MySQL server in order to properly run the application.
